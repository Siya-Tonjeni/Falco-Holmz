                <h3>UNGOWAMI - Single</h3>
                <p>25 SEPTEMBER , 2023</p>
                <div class="long-description">
                    <p>"UNGOWAMI," was released 
                        September 25th, 2023. The release date is particularly significant as it coincides with
                        Heritage Day, a day of celebrating cultural diversity and unity.
                        "UNGOWAMI" presents a remarkable extension from Falco Holmz's signature alternative
                        pop style, as he delves into the rich depths of Afro-pop, using his native language, isiXhosa,
                        to weave a captivating narrative. The song is a testament to his cultural heritage, reflecting
                        his deep connection to his roots.
                        At its heart, "Ungowami" is a touching love story, depicting the journey of a man who, after
                        years of yearning, embarks on a triumphant quest for genuine love. Falco Holmz's evocative
                        lyrics, combined with his melodic prowess, create an emotional resonance that resonates
                        with audiences across all walks of life.</p>

                <div class="long-description">
                    <p>This was not originally mine and was the only song recorded before the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of recording I was still finding my style as a new comer. This is the first time Falco Holmz was unleashed and I’ve never looked back.
                        I wrote the song from a perspective of a broken man looking to put the pieces back together but it’s too late.It took the longest time to finish the song due to unforeseen circumstances. At the end, the song later on became my debut single.</p>
